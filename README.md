### README: Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

---

## Overview

The **Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard** is a web application that provides insights into air quality across cities and allows users to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) based on pollutant levels. This application integrates data preprocessing, visualization, and prediction functionalities.

---

## Features

1. **AQI Trend Visualization**:
   - Displays historical AQI trends for selected cities using an interactive line chart.

2. **Correlation Heatmap**:
   - Provides a correlation matrix of pollutants and AQI for the selected city.

3. **AQI Prediction**:
   - Allows users to input pollutant levels (PM2.5 and PM10) to predict AQI using a pre-trained Random Forest model.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
- **pandas**: `pip install pandas`
- **plotly**: `pip install plotly`
- **dash**: `pip install dash`
- **dash-bootstrap-components**: `pip install dash-bootstrap-components`
- **joblib**: `pip install joblib`
- **numpy**: `pip install numpy`
- **scikit-learn**: `pip install scikit-learn`
- **matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib`
- **seaborn**: `pip install seaborn`

---

## File Structure

1. **air_quality_analysis.py**: 
   - Contains the preprocessing, visualization, and model training script. Produces:
     - `cleaned_airquality.csv` (preprocessed data)
     - `air_quality_model.joblib` (trained model)

2. **dashboard.py**: 
   - Main application script for the interactive dashboard.

3. **cleaned_airquality.csv**:
   - Preprocessed air quality data (generated by `air_quality_analysis.py`).

4. **air_quality_model.joblib**:
   - Pre-trained model for AQI prediction (generated by `air_quality_analysis.py`).

---

## Dataset

Download the raw dataset `airquality.csv` from the following link:

[Air Quality Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZepGo_MPAPV15mHBV8cZ0lYO6SoDp8w3/view?usp=drive_link)

Place this file in the same directory as the scripts before running the application.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Preprocess and Train the Model
1. Download the dataset (`airquality.csv`) using the link above.
2. Place the dataset in the same directory as `air_quality_analysis.py`.
3. Run `air_quality_analysis.py`:
   ```bash
   python air_quality_analysis.py
   ```
4. This will generate:
   - `cleaned_airquality.csv`
   - `air_quality_model.joblib`

### Step 2: Run the Dashboard
1. Ensure `cleaned_airquality.csv` and `air_quality_model.joblib` are in the same directory as `dashboard.py`.
2. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   python dashboard.py
   ```
3. Access the dashboard in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8050](http://127.0.0.1:8050).

## Inputs and Outputs

### AQI Prediction
- **Inputs**:
  - PM2.5 level
  - PM10 level
- **Outputs**:
  - Predicted AQI value

---

## Notes
- Default values for missing pollutant levels in the AQI prediction model are set to `0`. Replace these values with the mean/median of historical data if needed.
- Ensure the dataset and trained model are in the correct directory.
